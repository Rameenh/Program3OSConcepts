/*
 * Using a Poisson distribution with Î»=10, generate 1,000 page numbers per each of 1,000 experiments. For each experiment calculate
 * the number of faults using working set sizes ranging from 2 to 20 as determined by the LRU, FIFO, and Clock algorithms.
 * using an external program, plot the average number of faults for each working set for each algorithm (the plot is to
 * be included in the report).Make certain that your report identifies any special library requirements, if necessary to
 * support the Poisson distribution. Reference Figures 8.14 & 8.16.
